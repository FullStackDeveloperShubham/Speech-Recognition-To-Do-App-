# 🗣️ Speech-Recognition-To-Do-App

A hands-free, voice-controlled To-Do List application built with **React** and the **Web Speech API**. Easily add or delete tasks by simply speaking commands like “add buy milk” or “delete go gym”.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎤 **Voice Commands**: Add or delete tasks using natural speech.
- 💾 **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in `localStorage`.
- 🧠 **Real-time Listening**: Automatically listens and updates the list.
- 🎨 **Clean UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern interface.

## 🗣️ Example Voice Commands

- ✅ `add buy milk` → Adds "buy milk" to your list
- ❌ `delete go gym` → Removes "go gym" from your list

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- ⚛️ **React** – Frontend framework
- 🎙️ **Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition)** – Voice recognition
- 💅 **Tailwind CSS** – Styling
- 🌐 **localStorage** – Persistent data storage

## 🧩 How It Works

1. On page load, the app starts listening.
2. When you say:
   - **"add [task]"** → It adds the task.
   - **"delete [task]"** → It deletes the task if it exists.
3. Your tasks are stored locally, so they persist across sessions.
